            <p>Over the years I have tried many different restaurant matzo ball soup recipes. With conviction I can say one thing; most of them are lackluster.
                Either the matzo balls are way too big, the chicken is springy, or the broth is watered down. Yet people tend
                to settle for these restaurant matzo ball soups because they think that it is too difficult to make it themselves. Well I'm here to 
                tell you that making a high quality matzo ball soup is extremely easy. All it takes is finding the right ingredients and a bit
                of patience. I guarantee that once you try this recipe you'll never want to try another.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 bag of unpeeled carrots (about 10-15 carrots)</li>
                <li>8-10 unpeeled parsnips</li>
                <li>1 large bunch of celery</li>
                <li>1 white onion</li>
                <li>1 whole organic chicken</li>
                <li>1 fennel bulb with stalks (normally I use 1 large bunch of dill but it can be hard to find)</li>
                <li>kosher salt</li>
                <li>black pepper (fresh cracked if possible)</li>
                <li>paprika</li>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut off the tips and butt ends of celery, carrots, and parsnips. Cut off the bulb of the
                    fennel.
                </li>
                <li>Peel carrots and parsnips (no need to wash)</li>
                <li>Wash the celery and fennel stalks</li>
                <li>Chop carrots, parsnips, and celery into bite sized chunks. Leave the fennel stalks whole.</li>
                <li>Cut off both ends of the onion and peel off its outer layer. Keep the onion whole.</li>
                <li>Give the chicken a good rinse and make sure to take out the giblets if there are any (we won't need them).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <img class="photo" src="images/chopped_ingredients.jpg" alt="chopped vegetables">
        <div class="instructions">
            <ol start="7">
                <li>Fill a 12 qt pot halfway with water and set to boil.</li>
                <li>Once the water starts boiling, throw in all of the veggies and the chicken. The cold chicken will make 
                    the water drop below boiling so make sure to keep the temperature on high until the water starts boiling again.
                </li>
                <li>Add 2 tablespoons of kosher salt and 1/2 tablespoon of black pepper into the pot. Turn the heat down to
                    medium low (2 - 3 on an electric stove) and put the lid on the pot. Set a timer for 1 hour.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <ol start="10">
                <li>Once the timer goes off take the chicken out of the pot and place into a pyrex pan. This
                    part can be a little tricky as the chicken tends to fall apart. I get it out by using tongs,
                    placing one end of the tong in the hole of the chicken and quickly putting the chicken in the pan
                    to avoid getting burned by the hot water. Use whichever method you think is most effective and safest.
                </li>
                <li>Take out the fennel and throw away.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat down to low.</li>
                <li>Set your oven to broil. Season the chicken with kosher salt, black pepper, and paprika. Once the oven gets
                    hot enough put the chicken on the lower rack. With the oven light on, watch the top of the chicken. You want 
                    the skin to crisp up without it burning. Usually you only need to broil it for about 1-2 minutes. But whatever you
                    do, do not walk away from it!
                </li>
                <li>Once the chicken is broiled, set it aside.</li>
                <li>The last major step is to skim off the fat on the surface of the soup. I use a ladel, slowly dipping it on any large
                    fat globules to collect the fat. Repeat this process until most of the fat is gone (there will still be fat in the
                    soup which is good. It needs some fat for flavor. We just don't want it too be TOO fatty.)

            <h3>You're all finished! Sort of...</h3>
            <p>The last thing you will need to tie everything together is to make the matzo balls and egg noodles. I prefer to use the matzo
                ball mix that comes in a box as it is quicker and easier to make but use whichever is easier to find. As for the noodles, I normally
                prefer the thin kind but had to use the wider ones as that was all I could find. I am not leaving instructions here on how to make the matzo
                balls or noodles since both will have instructions on their packaging. You got this!
